Adjustments needed for the code: 

1) Account for the initial mass of the rocket instead of the initial pressure. Use the inital mass to define launch pressure, 
since mass is a the only independent variable (controlled by user). 

2) Add drag force to both while loops (determine drag coefficient). 

3) Determine whether transverse wind forces need to be accounted for. If yes, determine the effect they have on velocity (most likely a 
trigonometric relationship). 

4) Determine whether the temperature needs to be accounted for. If yes, determine the effect it has on the pressure relationships. 

5) Are we accounting for pressure change as a function of mass flow rate?
